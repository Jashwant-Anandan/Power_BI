SALES ANALYSIS FOR 2013 & 2014:
===============================

I consider this Power BI project as my first proper project. I have focused a lot on understanding the visualisation part of Power BI by understanding the various tricks and methods to improve a data visualisation. The most interesting thing was using bookmarks and pictured to create buttons like toggle button. Additionally, I also got a very good understanding of the working and design of many visuals. The dataset used for this project is an Power BI in-built data set called the financials. I also got a good understanding of the Power Query Editor, creation of relationship between tables in Relationshil view and the basic of DAX language. I have documented the steps I performed in Power Query Editor. In this I have focused on the technical side of Power BI rather than understanding the data and making proper sense of the data, so for choice of visuals I took inspration from various other projects online.
